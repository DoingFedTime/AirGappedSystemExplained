# Air-Gapped System Explained

![Air-Gapped System Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoingFedTime/AirGappedSystemExplained/refs/heads/main/air-gapped-system.svg)

A SVG visualization explaining air-gapped systems - physically isolated computers or networks that provide maximum security by maintaining a complete separation from unsecured networks.

## Overview

This visualization demonstrates:

* How air-gapped systems physically isolate sensitive data from external networks
* Why this isolation makes them immune to network-based attacks
* The proper methods for transferring data to/from air-gapped systems
* Key security features that define a true air-gapped environment

## Interactive Features

The SVG visualization includes:
* Animated network connection attempts being blocked by the air gap
* Visual comparison between connected and isolated systems
* Pulsing security indicators demonstrating protection status
* Interactive social media links with cyberpunk styling

## Technical Details

Air-gapped systems are defined by several critical security features:
* No network connections (wired or wireless)
* No Bluetooth or wireless capabilities
* Physically isolated from all other networked systems
* Data transfer only via removable physical media (after proper scanning)
* Immune to remote exploitation methods
* Ideal for high-security environments like critical infrastructure, military systems, and financial networks
